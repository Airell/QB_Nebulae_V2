AVALON - "Morphing Nebulaeum" v1.1, 19-10-2021
-------------------------------------------------
Inspired by the Morphing Terrarium E350 and the loading of samples from the Cloud Terrarium E352.
Like the Synthesis Technology E350 Morphing Terrarium, it can morph a wavetable bank of 64 waves in a 8x8 grid (X and Y) and from wave 1 to 64 (Z).
However, it is able to read wavetable banks from the E352. It does not implement all other advanced features of the E352. It also lacks FM.

E352 wavetable banks can be downloaded here, including the original E350 banks called 'Bank A', 'Bank B' and 'Bank C':

-------------------------------------------------
Limitations
-------------------------------------------------
- There is no FM like the original instruments. FM needs 'audio rate' frequency modulation, which CSound lacks in the used functions.
- There are small audio artefacts when pitch changes. This seems to come from Left and Right output bleeding...
- Knobs on the Nebulae are a bit 'quantized', it does not have the morph smoothness like the original instruments. Therefor a little slew is added.


-------------------------------------------------
Operation
-------------------------------------------------
Start:      X position
Density:    Y position
Speed:      Z position (coarse morph)
Size:       Z position (fine morph)
Size Alt:   Z position (fine morph range)
Blend:      Morphing between XY and Z. Different Morh modes available.
Blend Alt:  Morph Mode
File:       Advances to the next wavetable bank
Reset:      Resets to the first wavetable bank file, consecutive presses will advance 5 banks, starting from 0

-------------------------------------------------
Outputs
-------------------------------------------------
XY on the Left output
Z on the Right output (except Morph mode 4)


-------------------------------------------------
Morphing and Morph modes
-------------------------------------------------
Blend:

As an addition to the original instrument. AVALON allows for morphing between the XY and Z waves too.
There are different settings, where XY or Z are unchanged, whereas the other channel morphs between XY and Z.

Blend Alt:

Full CCW    - 1: Left channel: XY, Right channel Z. Morphs from Z  to XY  on the Right channel.                                           XYZ at 12 o'clock.
9 to 10     - 2: Left channel: XY, Right channel Z. Morphs from XY to Z   on the Left channel.                                            XYZ at 12 o'clock.
12 o'clock  - 3: Left channel: XY, Right channel Z. Morphs from XY to XYZ on the Left channel. Morphs from Z to XYZ on the Right channel. XYZ at fully CW.
14 to 15    - 4: Both channels: XY.                 Morphs from XY to Z   on Both channels.                                               XYZ at 12 o'clock.
Full CW     - 5: Left channel: XY, Right channel Z. Morphs from XY to Z   on the Left channel. Morphs from Z to XY on the Right channel.  XYZ at 12 o'clock.


-------------------------------------------------
Z fine morph and morph range
-------------------------------------------------
Size:

Morphing through Z (64 waves) is not very smooth, as the knob values are a bit 'quantized'.
The Size knob allows fine tuning of the Z morphing. The Size Alt (Shift/Secondary Size) defines the range of this fine tuning as 'an offset' to the Speed knobs Z morph.
Size at 12 o'clock mean no -/+ of offset.

Size Alt:

Full CCW    - 1 wave range, -/+ 0.5 'wave length'.
9 to 10     - 2 waves range, -/+ 1.0 'wave length'.
12 o'clock  - 4 waves range, -/+ 2.0 'wave length'.
14 to 15    - 6 waves range, -/+ 3.0 'wave length'.
Full CW     - 8 waves range, -/+ 4.0 'wave length'. This is equal to the range of X and Y.


-------------------------------------------------
Tips and tricks
-------------------------------------------------

Morph mode 5 is fun in stereo with modulation of the Blend knob (set to CCW for full modulation, knobs are 'offset' when CV is patched).


Have fun!
